# Tolerance

Our first "experiment" is called Tolerance. The core idea is, that
people are to answer ten essential questions. Afterwards, they are
presented with ten question-answer pairs of another person and are to
guess that person's nationality. We want to show, that most people
will not be able to guess the nationality right. The message is:

> People are not different and think the same way, also if they come
> from different parts of the world.

We wrote some articles about this project in german [here][y] and [here][c].

And it's online available under <http://tolerance.cwiwie.de> and
<http://tolerance.yhaupenthal.org>.
