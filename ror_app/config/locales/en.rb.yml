# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.

The concept of a nationality and nation gives us the feeling to belong to a group, which stands against other groups. Humans need this feeling of identification to not feel alone and work as a "team". You can see it in soccer (teams), in politics (parties), economics (companies, departments, ...) and the list goes on and on ...'
  start_p3: 'Evolution has made us this way, "survival of the fittest". The strongest survives. And since several together are stronger than individuals, groups emerged.'

In all the discussions about the so called "refugee-crisis" taking place in Europe at the moment we felt, that the emotional aspect was mostly neglected. When politicians are talking about refugees, it sounds like some abstract thing with no meaning. But think about it: Every single refugee behind those huge numbers of immigrants stands for one life. Such as yours. With family, or without. With unique characters and personality. Emotions and need for safety.'

  line_p50_1: "Putting pressure on your government to finally put an end to the bombs against the governments own people?"
  line_p51: "Easy."
  line_p52: "Right?"
  line_p53: ";-)"
  line_p54: "But, I want to be fair."
  line_p55: "It's difficult to fully <b>empathize</b> with people in such extreme conditions in the western countries."
  line_p56: "Because it's so peaceful here."
  line_p57: "And we simply don't know how war feels."
  line_p58: "Many western countries haven't encountered war for a long time."
  line_p59: "The younger generation only knows war from movies."
  line_p59_1: "And games."
  line_p59_2: "And the stories of their grandparents."
  line_p60: "So of course it's difficult to realize how those people really feel."
  line_p61: "But then."
  line_p61_1: "Just try it for a short moment. "
  line_p62: "Try to imagine, how it must feel like when you are surrounded by war."
  line_p63: "People dying around you."
  line_p63_1: "Every day."
  line_p64: "Your family is not safe."
  line_p65: "Your friends are not safe."
  line_p66: "Your house could be destroyed every day."
  line_p67: "Chaos lives in the streets of your city."
  line_p67_1: "And people are using that chaos to their advantage."
  line_p67_2: "Surpressing good-willed people."
  line_p67_3: "Who only want to work."
  line_p67_4: "And live in peace."
  line_p68: "I think the least of your worries is how Volkswagen manipulates their NOX filters."
  line_p69: "Or how your stock is developing."
  line_p70: "Or whether you need a faster PC for the next blockbuster game."
  line_p71: "So,"
  line_p71_1: "honestly?"
  line_p72: "I think you lack <b>awareness</b>."
  line_p73: "Because you haven't put yourself in the place of a Syrian."
  line_p74: "Because you lack real empathy for them."
  line_p75: "Because you keep your emotional distance to it."
  line_p76: "Awareness, how it must feel to have your own house bombed that you have payed off all your life since you were 23 years old."
  line_p77: "In which you lived with your wife for 16 years."
  line_p78: "In which you raised your two kids which are now going to grammar school. "
  line_p79: "How it must feel to have your religion forbidden by your rightfully elected government in which you believed strongly since you were a teenager and your grandpa told you that grandma is sitting up there and waiting for you."
  line_p80: "Awareness, how it must feel to loose first your wife and then your younger son."
  line_p80_1: "And that it is everyday life."
  line_p80_2: "Almost everyone has lost someone important."
  line_p81: "Having to flee your own country because your own government makes you and your kids illegal."
  line_p82: "Having nothing."
  line_p82_1: "Fighting for your life in cold,"
  line_p82_2: "without shelter,"
  line_p82_3: "in countries with other languages."
  line_p83: "Not knowing where home is."
  line_p84: "Arriving in a rich and stable country that gives you the hope to get the chance to build up a new life."
  line_p85: "Realizing that the people you hoped would help you, don't want you in their country. "
  line_p86: "Don't want to share with you."
  line_p87: "Spit on you. "
  line_p88: "Demonstrate against you on the streets."
  line_p88_1: "Calling you a pig,"
  line_p88_2: "parasite"
  line_p88_3: "and worse things."
  line_p89: "Yes."
  line_p90: "That's life."
  line_p91: "Not some game or some drama in the TV."
  line_p92: "It's <b>real</b> and happens every day."
  line_p92_1: "For them."
  line_p93: "They are not different from you."
  line_p94: "Just unlucky to be born in the wrong place at the wrong time."
  line_p95: "Awareness."
  line_p96: "Empathy."
  line_p97: "Humaneness."
  line_p98: "Now the fun part."
  line_p98_1: "Let's play a little game."
  line_p99: "I'll describe you ten situations."
  line_p99_1: "And you tell me how you would act."
  line_p100: "Nothing complex,"
  line_p100_1: "really."
  line_p100_2: "But <b>primal</b>."
  line_p101: "Some situations will be tough."
  line_p101_1: "So take your time..."
  line_p102: "The only rule: Be honest."
  line_p102_1: "To yourself."
  line_p103: "Don't think about it with your head only. <i>Feel</i>."
  line_p104: "That's all."
  line_p105: "And you will see, that I am right."
  line_p106: "And in the end, there's a little surprise for you. "
  line_p107: "You will see that you are closer to the Syrian people than you thought."
  line_p108: "That you are very similar to them in many aspects."
